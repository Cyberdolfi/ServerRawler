## How to prevent your server from being scanned

### Use description:
You can add `§b§d§f§d§b` to the end of your server's description by changing the `server.properties` file.  
This change is invisible to the client and won't change the appearance of your server's description *in most cases*.

If the server is discovered again in the future, it will be automatically excluded **and removed from the database**.

More information can be found [here](./guides/hiding-server.mdx).
