# Getting started

Welcome to the ServerRawler installation guide!

:::danger[Important Notice]

This guide is just a base for an example of the installation process.  
Please wait until the first stable release.

:::


## Prerequisites

You are expected to understand how to read documentation to use this project.  
We have spent many hours detailing how to install or upgrade our software, so please  
take some time and read rather than copy and pasting and then complaining when things do not work.  
It's always better to read the current step to the end before executing any commands.

:::warning[Operating Systems]

Not every operating system is officially supported.  
The following operating systems have been tested and are known to work well or not work well with ServerRawler:

:::

| Operating System |  Version  | Supported |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Ubuntu           | 24.04 LTS | ✅        |

It's possible that ServerRawler works on other operating systems as well, but they haven't been tested yet.  
You are welcome to try it out and report your findings in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vbZ2FKyjMN).

## Dependencies

- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) (for database storage)

If you want to compile ServerRawler from source, you will also need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (to clone the repository)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (to build the project)
- A C/C++ compiler (like `build-essential`)

### Example Dependency Installation

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu/Debian', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}
  groupId="operating-systems"
  queryString="os">
    <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu/Debian">
        User installation:  
        If you already have a MySQL server installed, you can skip this step.
        ```bash title="User"
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y mysql-server
        ```

        Developer installation:  
        For more clear information about installing rust, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
        ```bash title="Developer"
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y git curl mysql-server # basic dependencies
        sudo apt install -y build-essential rustup # install build tools and rust

        # Install rust via rustup
        rustup install stable
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Download Files
The first step in this process is to create the folder where the ServerRawler  
will live and then move ourselves into that newly created folder.  
Below is an example of how to set the project up.

Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Cyberdolfi/ServerRawler/releases/latest)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ubuntu"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ubuntu/Debian', value: 'ubuntu'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
  ]}
  groupId="operating-systems"
  queryString="os">
    <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu/Debian">
        Users can download the latest release with wget:

        ```bash title="User"
        mkdir ServerRawler
        cd ServerRawler
        curl -o serverrawler.tar.gz https://github.com/Cyberdolfi/ServerRawler/releases/latest/download/serverrawler.tar.gz
        ```

        Developers can clone the repository instead:

        ```bash title="Developer"
        git clone https://github.com/Cyberdolfi/ServerRawler.git
        cd ServerRawler
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
